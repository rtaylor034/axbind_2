# AxBind

> Dotfile management for the indecisive.

#### Note:

*Eventually will have binary/package posted, but as of right now `axbind` must be built from source.*

## Description

`axbind` is program intended to automate the task of editing multiple dotfiles when making a single abstract change to keybindings/colors/etc.. `axbind` may be especially useful for users with alternate keyboard layouts or highly personalized configs.

### Overview 
- Set mappings (key-value pairs) that are applied to all files of a directory.
- Control how mappings behave for any specific file they affect via remapping or functions.
