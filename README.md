# AxBind

> Dotfile management for the indecisive.

#### Note:

*I will eventually will have binary/package posted, but as of right now `axbind` must be built from source.*

## Description

`axbind` is text-replacement program written in Rust that is specialized for setting universal key-bindings (among other things) across dotfiles.

At a very surface level, `axbind` reads `key`-`value` pairs set by the user, then replaces all instances of set `key`s with their associated `value`, in all files under a specified directory.
### Features
