# AxBind

> Dotfile management for the indecisive.

#### Note:

*Eventually will have binary/package posted, but as of right now `axbind` must be built from source.*

## Description

`axbind` is program intended to automate the task of editing multiple dotfiles when making a single abstract change to keybindings/colors/etc.

`axbind` adresses a relatively specific issue, and may not be useful to all users.

Those that may find `axbind` useful include:
- Users that wish to have the same universal keybinds across programs.
- Users that wish to have the same custom universal colors/theme across programs.
- Users with highly modified configurations.
- Users that use alternative keyboard layouts.
